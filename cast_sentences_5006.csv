0,Finkenauer and Rimé investigated the memory of the unexpected death of Belgium’s King Baudouin in 1993 in a large sample of Belgian citizens
1,The data revealed that the news of the king’s death had been widely socially shared
2,"By talking about the event, people gradually constructed a social narrative and a collective memory of the emotional event"
3,"At the same time, they consolidated their own memory of the personal circumstances in which the event took place, an effect known as “flashbulb memory.” The more an event is socially shared, the more it will be fixed in people’s minds"
4,Social sharing may in this way help to counteract some natural tendency people may have
5,"Naturally, people should be driven to “forget” undesirable events"
6,"Thus, someone who just heard a piece of bad news often tends initially to deny what happened. 0번 문단"
7,"Minorities tend not to have much power or status and may even be dismissed as troublemakers, extremists or simply ‘weirdos’"

9,"Minorities that are active and organised, who support and defend their position consistently, can create social conflict, doubt and uncertainty among members of the majority, and ultimately this may lead to social change"
10,Such change has often occurred because a minority has converted others to its point of view
11,"Without the influence of minorities, we would have no innovation, no social change"
12,Many of what we now regard as ‘major’ social movements (e.g
13,"Christianity, trade unionism or feminism) were originally due to the influence of an outspoken minority. 1번 문단"
14,"Heritage is concerned with the ways in which very selective material artefacts, mythologies, memories and traditions become resources for the present"
15,"The contents, interpretations and representations of the resource are selected according to the demands of the present; an imagined past provides resources for a heritage that is to be passed onto an imagined future"
16,It follows too that the meanings and functions of memory and tradition are defined in the present
17,"Further, heritage is more concerned with meanings than material artefacts"
18,"It is the former that give value, either cultural or financial, to the latter and explain why they have been selected from the near infinity of the past"
19,"In turn, they may later be discarded as the demands of present societies change, or even, as is presently occurring in the former Eastern Europe, when pasts have to be reinvented to reflect new presents. 2번 문단"

23,"Likewise, when we learn Arabic numerals we build a circuit to quickly convert those shapes into quantities ― a fast connection from bilateral visual areas to the parietal quantity area"
24,Even an invention as elementary as finger-counting changes our cognitive abilities dramatically
25,"Amazonian people who have not invented counting are unable to make exact calculations as simple as, say, 6—2"
26,This “cultural recycling” implies that the functional architecture of the human brain results from a complex mixture of biological and cultural constraints. 3번 문단
27,"Biological organisms, including human societies both with and without market systems, discount distant outputs over those available at the present time based on risks associated with an uncertain future"
28,"As the timing of inputs and outputs varies greatly depending on the type of energy, there is a strong case to incorporate time when assessing energy alternatives"
29,"For example, the energy output from solar panels or wind power engines, where most investment happens before they begin producing, may need to be assessed differently when compared to most fossil fuel extraction technologies, where a large proportion of the energy output comes much sooner, and a larger (relative) proportion of inputs is applied during the extraction process, and not upfront"
30,"Thus fossil fuels, particularly oil and natural gas, in addition to having energy quality advantages (cost, storability, transportability, etc.) over many renewable technologies, also have a “temporal advantage” after accounting for human behavioral preference for current consumption/return. 4번 문단"
31,"Apocalypse Now, a film produced and directed by Francis Ford Coppola, gained widespread popularity, and for good reason"
32,"The film is an adaptation of Joseph Conrad’s novel Heart of Darkness, which is set in the African Congo at the end of the 19th century"

36,How many of the lunches that you ate over the last week can you recall? Do you remember what you ate today? I hope so
37,Yesterday? I bet it takes a moment’s effort
38,"And what about the day before yesterday? What about a week ago? It’s not so much that your memory of last week’s lunch has disappeared; if provided with the right cue, like where you ate it, or whom you ate it with, you would likely recall what had been on your plate"
39,"Rather, it’s difficult to remember last week’s lunch because your brain has filed it away with all the other lunches you’ve ever eaten as just another lunch"
40,"When we try to recall something from a category that includes as many instances as “lunch” or “wine,” many memories compete for our attention"

45,"As an example, in Kenya, farmers are actively encouraged to grow export crops such as tea and coffee at the expense of basic food production"
46,"The result is that a staple crop, such as maize, is not being produced in a sufficient amount"
47,"The essential argument here is that the capitalist mode of production is affecting peasant production in the less developed world in such a way as to limit the production of staple foods, thus causing a food problem. 7번 문단"

49,"As we invent more species of AI, we will be forced to surrender more of what is supposedly unique about humans"
50,"Each step of surrender ─ we are not the only mind that can play chess, fly a plane, make music, or invent a mathematical law ─ will be painful and sad"
51,"We’ll spend the next three decades ─ indeed, perhaps the next century ─ in a permanent identity crisis, continually asking ourselves what humans are good for"
52,"If we aren’t unique toolmakers, or artists, or moral ethicists, then what, if anything, makes us special? In the grandest irony of all, the greatest benefit of an everyday, utilitarian AI will not be increased productivity or an economics of abundance or a new way of doing science ─ although all those will happen. 8번 문단"
53,"Time spent on on-line interaction with members of one’s own, preselected community leaves less time available for actual encounters with a wide variety of people"
54,"If physicists, for example, were to concentrate on exchanging email and electronic preprints with other physicists around the world working in the same specialized subject area, they would likely devote less time, and be less receptive to new ways of looking at the world"
55,Facilitating the voluntary construction of highly homogeneous social networks of scientific communication therefore allows individuals to filter the potentially overwhelming flow of information
56,"But the result may be the tendency to overfilter it, thus eliminating the diversity of the knowledge circulating and diminishing the frequency of radically new ideas"
57,"In this regard, even a journey through the stacks of a real library can be more fruitful than a trip through today’s distributed virtual archives, because it seems difficult to use the available “search engines” to emulate efficiently the mixture of predictable and surprising discoveries that typically result from a physical shelf-search of an extensive library collection. 9번 문단"

62,"Our characters’ emotions, after all, draw on our own emotions"
63,"Sometimes, however, you will want to use your life more directly in your fiction, dramatizing actual incidents"
64,Charles Dickens used his desperate experience as a child laborer in Victorian England to write David Copperfield
65,"Should you create a protagonist based directly on yourself? As the writer, you’re too close to your own complicated makeup"
66,It can thus be easier and more effective to use a situation or incident from your life but make it happen to a character who is not you
67,"In fact, that’s what authors largely have done"
68,"You can still, of course, incorporate aspects of yourself: your love of Beethoven, your quick temper, your soccer injuries"
69,"But by applying your own experience to a different protagonist, you can take advantage of your insider knowledge of the situation, and yet gain an objectivity and control that the original intense situation, by definition, did not have. 10번 문단"

80,"However, most applications in geography and environmental studies do not require extremely fine-grained temporal resolution"
81,"Meteorologists may require visible, infrared, and radar information at sub-hourly temporal resolution; urban planners might require imagery at monthly or annual resolution; and transportation planners may not need any time series information at all for some applications"
82,Sometimes researchers have to search archives of aerial photographs to get information from that past that pre-date the collection of satellite imagery. 12번 문단
83,"Grief is unpleasant. Would one not then be better off without it altogether? Why accept it even when the loss is real? Perhaps we should say of it what Spinoza said of regret: that whoever feels it is “twice unhappy or twice helpless.” Laurence Thomas has suggested that the utility of “negative sentiments” (emotions like grief, guilt, resentment, and anger, which there is seemingly a reason to believe we might be better off without) lies in their providing a kind of guarantee of authenticity for such dispositional sentiments as love and respect"
84,No occurrent feelings of love and respect need to be present throughout the period in which it is true that one loves or respects
85,"At such times, negative emotions like grief offer a kind of testimonial to the authenticity of love or respect. 13번 문단"

94,"Some residents feel tourism provides more parks and recreation areas, improves the quality of the roads and public facilities, and does not contribute to ecological decline"
95,"Many do not blame tourism for traffic problems, overcrowded outdoor recreation, or the disturbance of peace and tranquility of parks"
96,"Alternatively, some residents express concern that tourists overcrowd the local fishing, hunting, and other recreation areas or may cause traffic and pedestrian congestion"
97,"Some studies suggest that variations in residents’ feelings about tourism’s relationship to environmental damage are related to the type of tourism, the extent to which residents feel the natural environment needs to be protected, and the distance residents live from the tourist attractions. 15번 문단"
98,Duration refers to the time that events last
99,"If we think of tempo as the speed of events, then duration is the speed of the clock itself"
100,"For the physicist, the duration of a “second” is precise and unambiguous: it is equal to 9,192,631,770 cycles of the frequency associated with the transition between two energy levels of the isotope cesium-133"

141,This 15% (actually －15%) figure would then represent “average” performance
142,Perhaps the best salesperson in the year had only a 3% drop in sales over the previous year
143,"Thus, “good” performance in this situation is a smaller loss compared to some average or norm group. 21번 문단"
144,We might describe science that has no known practical value as basic science or basic research

191,These differences may reflect the greater need of larger groups to solve organizational problems
192,"Members may realize that their behavior must become more goal-directed, since it is unlikely that they can coordinate their actions without making a special effort to do so"

214,"Through the use of the scientific method to determine the facts of any given policy situation, the power of social constructions is supposedly diminished, and solutions to social problems are discovered in an objective way"
215,This process creates an illusion of neutrality and implies a transcendence of the pitfalls and inequalities commonly associated with policymaking
216,"From this perspective, scientists and professionals emerge as the appropriate experts to be consulted in policymaking, while local citizen input and knowledge is often viewed as unnecessary"
217,Scientific and professional policy design does not necessarily escape the pitfalls of degenerative politics
218,Scientific and professional expertise often relies on a particular type of knowledge that is limited to utility and rationality considerations

228,Science is universal in principle but in practice it speaks to very few
229,"Mathematics may be considered a communication skill of the highest type, frictionless so to speak; and at the opposite pole from mathematics, the fruits of science show the practical benefits of science without the use of words"

240,Oil and gas resources are not likely to be impacted by climate change because they result from a process that takes millions of years and are geologically trapped
241,"Thus, while climate change may not impact these resources, oil and gas reserves and known or potential resources could be affected by new climate conditions, since climate change may affect access to these resources"
242,"In Siberia, for instance, the actual exploration challenge is the time required to access, produce, and deliver oil under extreme environmental conditions, where temperatures in January range from —20℃ to —35℃"
243,"Warming may ease extreme environmental conditions, expanding the production frontier. 35번 문단"

245,"For example, after the consumer has agreed to purchase a car for $8,000, the salesperson begins to add on $100 for tax and $200 for tires"
246,These additional costs might be thought of as a metaphorical ‘low ball’ that the salesperson throws the consumer
247,One explanation for the effectiveness of low-balling is in terms of self-perception theory
248,"When the consumer agrees to purchase the product under the original terms, that behavior might be used by the consumer to infer his sincere interest in the product"
249,This inferred sincere interest in the product may enable him to endure the increased cost
250,An alternative explanation is in terms of impression management theory
251,"If the consumer were to withdraw from the deal after the ‘slight’ change in the terms of agreement, he might foster the rather undesirable impression of being an irresponsible consumer unaware of these necessary charges. 36번 문단"

259,"However, from a human point of view, objectivity is just another attitude"
260,It is an interpretation that deliberately ignores our feelings
261,"It is very useful to ensure that scientific measurements are taken accurately and so on, but as far as life is concerned, it is a bit like turning the color off on your TV so that you see everything in black and white and then saying that is more truthful"

277,"So what happens when a player is moved to a team whose baseball park has better conditions for home runs than his current one ― say, 28 percent better? One analysis found that the player hit 60 percent more home runs"
278,Why? The answer lies in how achievable you think the goal is
279,"If you think you are likely to hit more home runs, you are more likely to swing for the fences"
280,"But if you think your chance of hitting a home run is smaller, your brain will send you signals to just try for a single to get on base"

306,"If language is based on genes and is the key to cultural evolution, and Neanderthals had language, then why did the Neanderthal toolkit show so little cultural change? Moreover, genes would undoubtedly have changed during the human revolution after 200,000 years ago, but more in response to new habits than as causes of them"

310,"To describe what happens to common resources as a result of human greed, Garrett Hardin used the example of an area of pasture on which all the cattle-owners are permitted to graze their animals free of charge"

312,The disadvantage is that the extra grazing contributes to the deterioration of the pasture
313,"However, the disadvantage is shared among all the cattle-owners using the pasture, so the individual owner suffers only a fraction of the disadvantage"

320,“It appears that measures that protect drivers from the consequences of bad driving encourage bad driving
321,"The principal effect of seat belt legislation has been a shift in the burden of risk from those already best protected in cars, to the most vulnerable, pedestrians and cyclists, outside cars.” Adams started to group these counterintuitive findings under the concept of risk compensation, the idea that humans have an inborn tolerance for risk"

326,"What should writers do when they’re teased by intriguing but elusive ideas, by hints of thoughts that seem too vague to be expressed in words? Edgar Allan Poe’s advice is simple: They should pick up their pens (or, he might add today, power up their laptops)"
327,"“For my own part,” he said in an 1846 article in Graham’s Magazine, “I have never had a thought which I could not set down in words, with even more distinctness than that with which I conceived it.” The “mere act” of writing, Poe believed, helps writers make their ideas not only clearer but more logical"
328,"To use his phrase, the process of writing contributes to “the logicalization of thought.” Whenever he felt dissatisfied with a vague “conception of the brain,” Poe said, “I resort forthwith to the pen, for the purpose of obtaining, through its aid, the necessary form, consequence and precision.” Today’s advocates of freewriting would probably agree with Poe on this point"

335,"If the coin is tossed and the outcome is concealed, people will offer lower amounts when asked for bets"
336,"In this case, control of the outcome is clearly an illusion"
337,"This perception occurs in investing, as well"

Perhaps because you expected a different critical scrutiny in the two groups"

355,"Often in social scientific practice, even where evidence is used, it is not used in the correct way for adequate scientific testing"
356,"In much of social science, evidence is used only to affirm a particular theory ― to search for the positive instances that uphold it"
357,"But these are easy to find and lead to the familiar dilemma in the social sciences where we have two conflicting theories, each of which can claim positive empirical evidence in its support but which come to opposite conclusions"
358,How should we decide between them? Here the scientific use of evidence may help
359,"For what is distinctive about science is the search for negative instances ― the search for ways to falsify a theory, rather than to confirm it"

364,Mediation is a process that has much in common with advocacy but is also crucially different
365,"It parallels advocacy in so far as it tends to involve a process of negotiation, but differs in so far as mediation involves adopting a neutral role between two opposing parties rather than taking up the case of one party against another"
366,"At times, particularly in very complex situations, the processes of advocacy and mediation can overlap, perhaps with very problematic results, as one loses clarity over his or her role"
367,"It is therefore important, if not essential, to maintain a clear focus in undertaking advocacy or mediation in order to ensure that the roles do not become blurred and therefore potentially counterproductive"
368,"For example, a mediator who ‘takes sides’ is likely to lose all credibility, as is an advocate who seeks to adopt a neutral position. 58번 문단"

373,"If the dreamer then calls and finds that the loved one has died, it is understandable for him or her to assume that the dream was a premonition of that death"
374,"But this is a mistake. To prove the existence of premonitory dreams, scientific evidence must be obtained"
375,We would need to do studies in which individuals are sampled in terms of their dream life and judges are asked to make correspondences between these dream events and events that occurred in real life
376,"A problem that arises here is that individuals who believe in premonitory dreams may give one or two striking examples of ‘hits,’ but they never tell you how many of their premonitory dreams ‘missed.’ Until we have that evidence, it is better to believe that the assumption is false. 59번 문단"

379,A bat that fails to feed for two nights is likely to die
380,"Wilkinson showed that the blood donors are typically sharing their surpluses and, in so doing, are saving unsuccessful foragers that are close to starvation"

385,"Big words are resented by persons who don’t understand them and, of course, very often they are used to confuse and impress rather than clarify"

415,"As a result, there is little or none of that alienation of young from old so marked in modern industrial societies"
416,A further reason for this alienation in modern societies is that in his conception of reality the modern adult owes less to his direct experience and more to the experience of his culture than does primitive man

909,Theories of all sorts promote the view that there are ways by which disagreement can be processed or managed so as to make it disappear

920,It is these sorts of unexpected complexities and apparent contradictions that make ecology so interesting
921,"The idea of a fish in a freshwater lake struggling to accumulate salts inside its body to mimic the ocean reminds one of the other great contradiction of the biosphere: plants are bathed in an atmosphere composed of roughly three-quarters nitrogen, yet their growth is frequently restricted by lack of nitrogen. 156번 문단"

930,"These cultural products ― be they paintings, sculptures, forms of music or whatever ― should be regarded as being made by certain types of cultural producer, and as being used by particular groups of people in particular ways in specific social contexts"
931,"By using the more neutral term ‘cultural products’ for particular objects, and ‘cultural producers’ for the people who make those objects, the sociologist seeks to break with a view that she/he sees as having dominated the study of cultural forms for too long, namely trying to understand everything in terms of the category ‘art’"
932,This is a category that is too limited and context-specific to encompass all the different cultural products that people in different societies make and use
933,It is a term that is also too loaded to take at face value and to use naively in study of our own society
934,"Since it is in the interests of certain social groups to define some things as ‘art’ and others as not, the very term ‘art’ itself cannot be uncritically used by the sociologist who wishes to understand how and why such labelling processes occur"

2276,"As a result, they have gone beyond the natural environment"
2277,"Their works use everything from neon lights and computers to the artists’ own bodies, as artistic mediums"
2278,"Artists and art works can therefore become identical, as in the case of Body Art"
2279,"On the other hand, they can be distant from each other"

2285,"In recent years, we’ve been dreaming very different dreams"
2286,"The stuff of these dreams is fantasy ― swords and wizards, knights and ladies"
2287,"The business of fantasy has become a multibillion-dollar reality, and science fiction is starting to feel old-fashioned"
2288,"Our fascination with science fiction reflected a deep faith that technology would lead us to a cyber utopia, with robot servants serving food"
2289,"But in fact, a dark, pessimistic attitude toward technology and the future is attracting more and more people"
2290,"And the evidence is the world’s new concern with a nostalgic, magical vision of the past: swords, not lasers; magic, not electricity; villages, not cities; the past, not the future. 375번 문단"

2308,"War is inconceivable without some image, or concept, of the enemy"
2309,It is the presence of the enemy that gives meaning and justification to war
2310,"‘War follows from feelings of hatred’, wrote Carl Schmitt"
2311,"‘War has its own strategic, tactical, and other rules and points of view, but they all presuppose that the political decision has already been made as to who the enemy is’"
2312,The concept of the enemy is fundamental to the moral assessment of war: ‘The basic aim of a nation at war in establishing an image of the enemy is to distinguish as sharply as possible the act of killing from the act of murder’
2313,"However, we need to be cautious about thinking of war and the image of the enemy that informs it in an abstract and uniform way"

2319,"But it’s wrong. Great scientists, the pioneers that we admire, are not concerned with results but with the next questions"
2320,The highly respected physicist Enrico Fermi told his students that an experiment that successfully proves a hypothesis is a measurement; one that doesn’t is a discovery
2321,"A discovery, an uncovering―of new ignorance"
2322,"The Nobel Prize, the pinnacle of scientific accomplishment, is awarded, not for a lifetime of scientific achievement, but for a single discovery, a result"
2323,"Even the Nobel committee realizes in some way that this is not really in the scientific spirit, and their award citations commonly honor the discovery for having “opened a field up,” “transformed a field,” or “taken a field in new and unexpected directions.” 379번 문단"
2324,"With the industrial society evolving into an information-based society, the concept of information as a product, a commodity with its own value, has emerged"
2325,"As a consequence, those people, organizations, and countries that possess the highest-quality information are likely to prosper economically, socially, and politically"
2326,"Investigations into the economics of information encompass a variety of categories including the costs of information and information services; the effects of information on decision making; the savings from effective information acquisition; the effects of information on productivity; and the effects of specific agencies (such as corporate, technical, or medical libraries) on the productivity of organizations"
2327,"Obviously many of these areas overlap, but it is clear that information has taken on a life of its own outside the medium in which it is contained"
2328,"Information has become a recognized entity to be measured, evaluated, and priced. 380번 문단"

2331,Increasing aid for the world’s poorest peoples can be an essential part of effective mitigation
2332,"With 20 percent of carbon emissions from (mostly tropical) deforestation, carbon credits for forest preservation would combine aid to poorer countries with one of the most cost-effective forms of abatement"
2333,Perhaps the most cost-effective but politically complicated policy reform would be the removal of several hundred billions of dollars of direct annual subsidies from the two biggest recipients in the OECD―destructive industrial agriculture and fossil fuels
2334,"Even a small amount of this money would accelerate the already rapid rate of technical progress and investment in renewable energy in many areas, as well as encourage the essential switch to conservation agriculture. 381번 문단"
2335,A defining element of catastrophes is the magnitude of their harmful consequences
2336,"To help societies prevent or reduce damage from catastrophes, a huge amount of effort and technological sophistication are often employed to assess and communicate the size and scope of potential or actual losses"
2337,This effort assumes that people can understand the resulting numbers and act on them appropriately
2338,"However, recent behavioral research casts doubt on this fundamental assumption"
2339,Many people do not understand large numbers
2340,"Indeed, large numbers have been found to lack meaning and to be underestimated in decisions unless they convey affect (feeling)"
2341,This creates a paradox that rational models of decision making fail to represent
2342,"On the one hand, we respond strongly to aid a single individual in need"
2343,"On the other hand, we often fail to prevent mass tragedies or take appropriate measures to reduce potential losses from natural disasters. 382번 문단"
2344,"Biological organisms, including human societies both with and without market systems, discount distant outputs over those available at the present time based on risks associated with an uncertain future"
2345,"As the timing of inputs and outputs varies greatly depending on the type of energy, there is a strong case to incorporate time when assessing energy alternatives"
2346,"For example, the energy output from solar panels or wind power engines, where most investment happens before they begin producing, may need to be assessed differently when compared to most fossil fuel extraction technologies, where a large proportion of the energy output comes much sooner, and a larger (relative) proportion of inputs is applied during the extraction process, and not upfront"
2347,"Thus fossil fuels, particularly oil and natural gas, in addition to having energy quality advantages (cost, storability, transportability, etc.) over many renewable technologies, also have a “temporal advantage” after accounting for human behavioral preference for current consumption/return 383번 문단"
2348,"Industrial capitalism not only created work, it also created ‘leisure’ in the modern sense of the term"
2349,"This might seem surprising, for the early cotton masters wanted to keep their machinery running as long as possible and forced their employees to work very long hours"
2350,"However, by requiring continuous work during work hours and ruling out non-work activity, employers had separated out leisure from work"
2351,"Some did this quite explicitly by creating distinct holiday periods, when factories were shut down, because it was better to do this than have work promoted by the casual taking of days off"
2352,"‘Leisure’ as a distinct non-work time, whether in the form of the holiday, weekend, or evening, was a result of the disciplined and bounded work time created by capitalist production"
2353,"Workers then wanted more leisure and leisure time was enlarged by union campaigns, which first started in the cotton industry, and eventually new laws were passed that limited the hours of work and gave workers holiday entitlements"
2354,"Leisure was also the creation of capitalism in another sense, through the commercialization of leisure"
2355,This no longer meant participation in traditional sports and pastimes
2356,Workers began to pay for leisure activities organized by capitalist enterprises
2357,"Mass travel to spectator sports, especially football and horse-racing, where people could be charged for entry, was now possible"
2358,"The importance of this can hardly be exaggerated, for whole new industries were emerging to exploit and develop the leisure market, which was to become a huge source of consumer demand, employment, and profit. 384번 문단"

2367,You have to challenge the conventional ways of doing things and search for opportunities to innovate
2368,Exercising leadership not only requires you to challenge the organizational status quo but also requires you to challenge your internal status quo

2373,One exercise in teamwork I do at a company retreat is to put the group in a circle
2374,"At one particular retreat, there were eight people in the circle, and I slowly handed tennis balls to one person to start throwing around the circle"
2375,"If N equals the number of people in the circle, then the maximum number of balls you can have in motion is N minus 1"
2376,Why? Because it’s almost impossible to throw and catch at the same time
2377,The purpose of the exercise is to demonstrate the importance of an individual’s action
2378,People are much more concerned about catching the ball than throwing it
2379,What this demonstrates is that it’s equally important to the success of the exercise that the person you’re throwing to catches the ball as that you are able to catch the ball
2380,"If you’re less concerned about how you deliver information than with how you receive it, you’ll ultimately fail at delegation"

2382,"Sensory-specific satiety is defined as a decrease in appetite, or the subjective liking for the food that is consumed, with little change in the hedonics of uneaten food"
2383,"As a result of sensory-specific satiety, when people consume a variety of foods, they tend to overeat"
2384,A greater variety of food leads people to eat more than they would otherwise
2385,"So, being full and feeling sated are separate matters"
2386,"The recovery of appetite or the motivation to eat is apparent to anyone who has consumed a large meal and is quite full, and does not require additional energy or nutrients to meet their daily needs, but decides to consume additional calories after seeing the dessert cart"
2387,Small changes in the sensory properties of foods are sufficient to increase food intake
2388,"For example, subjects who were presented with different shapes of pasta showed increased hedonic ratings and increased energy consumption relative to subjects eating only a single shape of pasta. 388번 문단"
2389,"Individual authors and photographers have rights to their intellectual property during their lifetimes, and their heirs have rights for 70 years after the creator’s death, so any publication less than 125 years old has to be checked for its copyright status"
2390,"The duration of copyright protection has increased steadily over the years; the life-plus-70-years standard was set by the Copyright Term Extension Act of 1998, which increased the 50-year limit established by the 1976 Copyright Act"
2391,"Supporters of such legislation like to defend these increases with tales of starving writers and their impoverished descendants, but in reality the beneficiaries are more likely to be transnational publishing companies"
2392,And note that copyright laws serve a dual purpose
2393,"In addition to protecting the rights of authors so as to encourage the publication of new creative works, copyright is also supposed to place reasonable time limits on those rights so that outdated works may be incorporated into new creative efforts"
2394,"Therefore, the extended copyright protection frustrates new creative endeavors such as including poetry and song lyrics on Internet sites. 389번 문단"
2395,"Time spent on on-line interaction with members of one’s own, preselected community leaves less time available for actual encounters with a wide variety of people"
2396,"If physicists, for example, were to concentrate on exchanging email and electronic preprints with other physicists around the world working in the same specialized subject area, they would likely devote less time, and be less receptive to new ways of looking at the world"
2397,Facilitating the voluntary construction of highly homogeneous social networks of scientific communication therefore allows individuals to filter the potentially overwhelming flow of information
2398,"But the result may be the tendency to overfilter it, thus eliminating the diversity of the knowledge circulating and diminishing the frequency of radically new ideas"
2399,"In this regard, even a journey through the stacks of a real library can be more fruitful than a trip through today’s distributed virtual archives, because it seems difficult to use the available “search engines” to emulate efficiently the mixture of predictable and surprising discoveries that typically result from a physical shelf-search of an extensive library collection. 390번 문단"

2406,Charles Dickens used his desperate experience as a child laborer in Victorian England to write David Copperfield
2407,Should you create a protagonist based directly on yourself? The problem with this─and it is a very large problem─is that almost no one can view himself on the page
2408,"As the writer, you’re too close to your own complicated makeup"
2409,It can thus be easier and more effective to use a situation or incident from your life but make it happen to a character who is not you
2410,"In fact, that’s what authors largely have done"
2411,"You can still, of course, incorporate aspects of yourself: your love of Beethoven, your quick temper, your soccer injuries"

2428,"The precision of the lines on the map, the consistency with which symbols are used, the grid and/or projection system, the apparent certainty with which place names are written and placed, and the legend and scale information all give the map an aura of scientific accuracy and objectivity"
2429,"Although subjective interpretation goes into the construction of these cartographic elements, the finished map appears to express an authoritative truth about the world, separate from any interests and influences"
2430,The very trust that this apparent objectivity inspires is what makes maps such powerful carriers of ideology
2431,"However unnoticeably, maps do indeed reflect the world views of either their makers or, more probably, the supporters of their makers, in addition to the political and social conditions under which they were made"

2433,"As a system for transmitting specific factual information without any distortion or ambiguity, the sign system of honey-bees would probably win easily over human language every time"
2434,"However, language offers something more valuable than mere information exchange"
2435,"Because the meanings of words are not invariable and because understanding always involves interpretation, the act of communicating is always a joint, creative effort"
2436,Words can carry meanings beyond those consciously intended by speakers or writers because listeners or readers bring their own perspectives to the language they encounter
2437,Ideas expressed imprecisely may be more intellectually stimulating for listeners or readers than simple facts
2438,The fact that language is not always reliable for causing precise meanings to be generated in someone else’s mind is a reflection of its powerful strength as a medium for creating new understanding
2439,It is the inherent ambiguity and adaptability of language as a meaning-making system that makes the relationship between language and thinking so special. 395번 문단

2447,"Some residents feel tourism provides more parks and recreation areas, improves the quality of the roads and public facilities, and does not contribute to ecological decline"
2448,"Many do not blame tourism for traffic problems, overcrowded outdoor recreation, or the disturbance of peace and tranquility of parks"
2449,"Alternatively, some residents express concern that tourists overcrowd the local fishing, hunting, and other recreation areas or may cause traffic and pedestrian congestion"
2450,"Some studies suggest that variations in residents’ feelings about tourism’s relationship to environmental damage are related to the type of tourism, the extent to which residents feel the natural environment needs to be protected, and the distance residents live from the tourist attractions. 397번 문단"

2454,"In the realm of psychological experience, however, quantifying units of time is a considerably clumsier operation"
2455,"When people are removed from the cues of “real” time─be it the sun, bodily fatigue, or timepieces themselves─it doesn’t take long before their time sense breaks down"
2456,"And it is this usually accurate psychological clock, as opposed to the time on one’s watch, that creates the perception of duration that people experience"

2473,"If your picture of a counselor is someone who never disagrees, always “goes along,” wants everything to be nice all the time, and only does what other people want himor her to do, this is not a picture of an assertive counselor"
2474,Being assertive does not have to mean being disagreeable
2475,Being a counselor does not mean that you should simply be silent when someone tells a racist joke
2476,"An assertive counselor would find a way to call that person’s attention to the fact that the joke is racist, explaining how it offended the hearer, and suggesting ways similar jokes could be avoided"

2478,The negative effects of extrinsic motivators such as grades have been documented with students from different cultures
2479,"Although this matter is more complex than simply regarding all extrinsic rewards as controlling or diminishing learning, we agree with Richard Ryan and his colleagues that people across different cultures are likely to express more satisfaction with their lives when their primary goals are intrinsic rather than extrinsic"
2480,"Another consistent research finding is that when a learning activity is undertaken explicitly to attain some extrinsic reward, people respond by seeking the least demanding way of ensuring the reward"
2481,"Since there are three decades of evidence that dominating instruction with a system of controlling external rewards may contribute to inferior learning, using a pedagogy based on theories of intrinsic motivation appears to be a more reasonable and effective approach to enhancing learning among culturally diverse students. 401번 문단"

2487,All other cultures are thus inferior
2488,Temporocentrism and ethnocentrism unite to cause individuals and cultures to judge all other individuals and cultures by the “superior” standards of their current culture

2493,"It is likely that age changes begin in different parts of the body at different times and that the rate of annual change varies among various cells, tissues, and organs, as well as from person to person"
2494,"Unlike the passage of time, biological aging resists easy measurement"
2495,"What we would like to have is one or a few measurable biological changes that mirror all other biological age changes without reference to the passage of time, so that we could say, for example, that someone who is chronologically eighty years old is biologically sixty years old"

2499,"One example is in sales. If there is a general downturn in the economy and products or services are not being purchased with the same frequency as in the previous year, sales could be down, for example, by an average of 15%"
2500,This 15% (actually －15%) figure would then represent “average” performance
2501,Perhaps the best salesperson in the year had only a 3% drop in sales over the previous year
2502,"Thus, “good” performance in this situation is a smaller loss compared to some average or norm group. 404번 문단"

2688,"For example, an American anthropologist attempted to tell the classic story of Hamlet to Tiv elders in West Africa"

2717,Mediation is a process that has much in common with advocacy but is also crucially different
2718,"It parallels advocacy in so far as it tends to involve a process of negotiation, but differs in so far as mediation involves adopting a neutral role between two opposing parties  rather than taking up the case of one party against another"

2728,"To prove the existence of premonitory dreams, scientific evidence must be obtained"
2729,We would need to do studies in which individuals are sampled in terms of their dream life and judges are asked to make correspondences between these dream events and events that occurred in real life
2730,"A problem that arises here is that individuals who believe in premonitory dreams may give one or two striking examples of ‘hits,’ but they never tell you how many of their premonitory dreams ‘missed.’ To do a scientific study of dream prophecy, we would need to establish some base of how commonly coincidental correspondences occur between dream and waking reality"

2741,Or Lincoln Dollars for picking up trash on the playground or for helping a young child find the bathroom ―deeds that used to be called ‘good citizenship.’ Why is it necessary to buy the minimal cooperation of children with rewards and treats?

4352,The problem however is that many organizations are poor in information and knowledge
4353,"This fact translates into one of the biggest challenges faced by organizations: how to transform raw data into information and eventually into knowledge, which if exploited correctly provides the capabilities to predict customers’ behaviour and business trends. 675번 문단"
4354,In the twelfth to thirteenth centuries there appeared the first manuals teaching “table manners” to the offspring of aristocrats
4355,"It was a genre that subsequently had a great success in the early modern period with The Courtier by Baldassare Castiglione, The Galateo by Monsignor Della Casa, and many others produced in different European countries"
4356,"In a variety of ways and meanings, these are all instruments intended to define or distinguish who is in from who is out, separating the participants from the ostracized"
4357,"It is for this reason that manuals of “good manners” addressed to the aristocracy always have a negative reference to the peasant who behaves badly, who “doesn’t know” what the rules are, and for this reason is excluded from the lordly table"
4358,Food etiquette had become a sign of social barriers and of the impossibility of breaking them down. 676번 문단
4359,"Racial and ethnic relations in the United States are better today than in the past, but many changes are needed before sports are a model of inclusion and fairness"
4360,"The challenges today are different from the ones faced twenty years ago, and experience shows that when current challenges are met, a new social situation is created in which new challenges emerge"
4361,"For example, once racial and ethnic segregation is eliminated and people come together, they must learn to live, work, and play with each other despite diverse experiences and cultural perspectives"
4362,"Meeting this challenge requires a commitment to equal treatment, plus learning about the perspectives of others, understanding how they define and give meaning to the world, and then determining how to form and maintain relationships while respecting differences, making compromises, and supporting one another in the pursuit of goals that may not always be shared"
4363,"None of this is easy, and challenges are never met once and for all time. 677번 문단"
4364,"After the United Nations environmental conference in Rio de Janeiro in 1992 made the term “sustainability” widely known around the world, the word became a popular buzzword by those who wanted to be seen as pro-environmental but who did not really intend to change their behavior"
4365,"It became a public relations term, an attempt to be seen as abreast with the latest thinking of what we must do to save our planet from widespread harm"
4366,"But then, in a decade or so, some governments, industries, educational institutions, and organizations started to use the term in a serious manner"
4367,In the United States a number of large corporations appointed a vice president for sustainability
4368,"Not only were these officials interested in how their companies could profit by producing “green” products, but they were often given the task of making the company more efficient by reducing wastes and pollution and by reducing its carbon emissions. 678번 문단"
4369,"Aristotle did not think that all human beings should be allowed to engage in political activity: in his system, women, slaves, and foreigners were explicitly excluded from the right to rule themselves and others"
4370,"Nevertheless, his basic idea that politics is a unique collective activity that is directed at certain common goals and ends still resonates today"
4371,But which ends? Many thinkers and political figures since the ancient world have developed different ideas about the goals that politics can or should achieve
4372,This approach is known as political moralism
4373,"For moralists, political life is a branch of ethics―or moral philosophy―so it is unsurprising that there are many philosophers in the group of moralistic political thinkers"
4374,"Political moralists argue that politics should be directed toward achieving substantial goals, or that political arrangements should be organized to protect certain things"
4375,"Among these things are political values such as justice, equality, liberty, happiness, fraternity, or national self-determination"
4376,"At its most radical, moralism produces descriptions of ideal political societies known as Utopias, named after English statesman and philosopher Thomas More’s book Utopia, published in 1516, which imagined an ideal nation"
4377,"Utopian political thinking dates back to the ancient Greek philosopher Plato’s book the Republic, but it is still used by modern thinkers such as Robert Nozick to explore ideas"
4378,"Some theorists consider Utopian political thinking to be a bad  undertaking, since it has led in the past to justifications of totalitarian violence"
4379,"However, at its best, Utopian thinking is part of a process of striving toward a better society, and many thinkers use it to suggest values to be pursued or protected. 679번 문단"

4382,Parents and children are going to spend time enjoying outdoor activities and having a picnic lunch
4383,It is therefore very important to check the garden for potential dangers
4384,Managers of each department must make sure that all dangerous equipment and machinery are safely stored
4385,"Also, for the safety of our guests at this event, garden chemicals will not be used anywhere in Nature’s Beauty Gardens"

4388,We say to ourselves: “There is plenty of time
4389,I’ll manage somehow or other when the time comes for action.” We are rather proud of our ability to meet emergencies
4390,So we do not plan and take precautions to prevent emergencies from arising
4391,"It is too easy to drift through school and college, taking the traditional, conventional studies that others take, following the lines of least resistance, electing “snap courses,” and going with the crowd"
4392,"It is too easy to take the attitude: “First I will get my education and develop myself, and then I will know better what I am fitted to do for a life work.” And so we drift, driven by the winds of circumstance, tossed about by the waves of tradition and custom"
4393,"Eventually, most men find they must be satisfied with “any port in a storm.” Sailors who select a port because they are driven to it have scarcely one chance in a thousand of dropping anchor in the right one. 681번 문단"
4394,Internet entrepreneurs are creating job-search products and bringing them online regularly
4395,"Within the past few years, new Internet-based businesses have come online that help people find internships, complete online classes tailored to individual employer job applications, or find volunteer work that will lead to full-time employment"
4396,Job mastery will mean keeping up with the rapidly evolving tools available on the Internet
4397,"It should be noted, though, that no development in the Internet job age has reduced the importance of the most basic job search skill: self-knowledge"
4398,"Even in the Internet age, the job search starts with identifying individual job skills, sector interests, and preferred workplace environment and interests"
4399,"Richard Bolles’ best selling job search book, first published in 1970, had as its central theme the self-inventory of skills and workplace preferences"
4400,This self-inventory continues to be the starting point for any job search today no matter what the Internet technology involved. 682번 문단
4401,"The term “biological control” has been used, at times, in a broad context to cover a full spectrum of biological organisms and biologically based products"
4402,"This has been spectacularly successful in many instances, with a number of pest problems permanently resolved by importation and successful establishment of natural enemies"
4403,These importation successes have been limited largely to certain types of ecosystems and/or pest situations such as introduced pests in perennial ecosystems
4404,"On the other hand, this approach has met with limited success for major pests of row crops or other ephemeral systems"
4405,"In these situations, the problem is often not the lack of effective natural enemies but management practices and a lack of concerted research on factors that determine the success or failure of importation attempts in the specific agro-ecosystem setting"
4406,"Thus, importation programs, to date, are largely a matter of trial and error based on experience of the individual specialists involved"
4407,"According to the individualist form of rhetoric about science, still much used for certain purposes, discoveries are made in laboratories"
4408,"They are the product of inspired patience, of skilled hands and an inquiring but unbiased mind"
4409,"Moreover, they speak for themselves, or at least they speak too powerfully and too insistently for prejudiced humans to silence them"
4410,"It would be wrong to suppose that such beliefs are not sincerely held, yet almost nobody thinks they can provide a basis for action in public contexts"
4411,Any scientist who announces a so-called discovery at a press conference without first permitting expert reviewers to examine his or her claims is automatically castigated as a publicity seeker
4412,"The norms of scientific communication presuppose that nature does not speak unambiguously, and that knowledge isn’t knowledge unless it has been authorized by disciplinary specialists"
4413,A scientific truth has little standing until it becomes a collective product
4414,What happens in somebody’s laboratory is only one stage in its construction. 684번 문단
4415,"In some subject areas, topics build on one another in a hierarchical fashion, so that a learner must almost certainly master one topic before moving to the next"
4416,"For example, an elementary school student should probably master principles of addition before moving to multiplication, because multiplication is an extension of addition"
4417,"Similarly, a medical student must have expertise in human anatomy before studying surgical techniques: It’s difficult to perform an appendectomy if you can’t find the appendix"
4418,Vertical transfer refers to such situations: A learner acquires new knowledge or skills by building on more basic information and procedures
4419,"In other cases, knowledge of one topic may affect learning a second topic even though the first isn’t a necessary condition for the second"
4420,"Knowledge of French isn’t essential for learning Spanish, yet knowing French can help with Spanish because many words are similar in the two languages"
4421,"When knowledge of the first topic is helpful but not essential to learning the second one, lateral transfer is occurring. 685번 문단"
4422,"By the turn of the twentieth century, the permanent repertoire of musical classics dominated almost every field of concert music, from piano, song, or chamber music recitals to operas and orchestral concerts"
4423,The change from a century before was enormous
4424,"In the eighteenth century, performers and listeners demanded new music all the time, and “ancient music” included anything written more than twenty years earlier"
4425,"But musicians and audiences in the early 1900s expected that most concert music they performed or heard would be at least a generation old, and they judged new music by the standards of the classics already enshrined in the repertoire"
4426,"In essence, concert halls and opera houses had become museums for displaying the musical artworks of the past two hundred years"
4427,"The repertoire varied according to the performing medium and from region to region, but the core was largely the same throughout most of Europe and the Americas, including operas and operatic excerpts from Mozart through Verdi, Wagner, and Bizet; orchestral and chamber music from Haydn through the late Romantics; and keyboard music by J.S"
4428,"Bach, Haydn, Mozart, Beethoven, and prominent nineteenth-century composers"
4429,Living composers increasingly found themselves in competition with the music of the past
4430,"This is the great theme of modern music in the classical tradition, especially in the first half of the century: in competing with past composers for the attention of performers and listeners who regarded the classical masterworks, living composers sought to secure a place for themselves by offering something new and distinctive while continuing the tradition"
4431,"They combined individuality and innovation with emulation of the past, seeking to write music that would be considered original and worthy of performance alongside the masterworks of earlier times. 686번 문단"

4437,You can choose a specific date and time depending on your schedule

4441,"Sure, we’ve all heard the advice: “Follow your passion.” It’s great when you hit the jackpot and find a career that melds your strengths and passions, and where there is demand in the highly competitive global marketplace of today"
4442,"But if your goal is to get a job at the end of the rainbow, you must distinguish between your major, your passions, your strengths, and your career path"
4443,Your strengths are more important than your passions
4444,"Studies show that the best career choices tend to be grounded in things you’re good at, more so than your interests and passions"
4445,"Ideally, you want to find a convergence of your strengths and your values with a career path that is in demand"
4446,Interests can come and go
4447,"Your strengths are your core, your hard-wired assets. 688번 문단"
4448,"Parents are quick to inform friends and relatives as soon as their infant holds her head up, reaches for objects, sits by herself, and walks alone"
4449,"Parental enthusiasm for these motor accomplishments is not at all misplaced, for they are, indeed, milestones of development"
4450,"With each additional skill, babies gain control over their bodies and the environment in a new way"
4451,Infants who are able to sit alone are granted an entirely different perspective on the world than are those who spend much of their day on their backs or stomachs
4452,"Coordinated reaching opens up a whole new avenue for exploration of objects, and when babies can move about, their opportunities for independent exploration and manipulation are multiplied"
4453,No longer are they restricted to their immediate locale and to objects that others place before them
4454,"As new ways of controlling the environment are achieved, motor development provides the infant with a growing sense of competence and mastery, and it contributes in important ways to the infant’s perceptual and cognitive understanding of the world"
4455,"It is a strategic and tactical mistake to give an offensive position away to those who will use it to attack, criticize, and blame"
4456,"Since opponents will undoubtedly attack, criticize, and blame, anyway, the advantages of being proactive, airing one’s own “dirty laundry,” and “telling on oneself” are too significant to ignore"
4457,Chief among these advantages is the ability to control the first messages and how a story is first framed
4458,That leaves others having to respond to you instead of the other way around
4459,"This approach is appropriately termed “stealing thunder.” When an organization steals thunder, it breaks the news about its own crisis before the crisis is discovered by the media or other interested parties"
4460,"In experimental research by Arpan and Roskos-Ewoldsen, stealing thunder in a crisis situation, as opposed to allowing the information to be first disclosed by another party, resulted in substantially higher credibility ratings"
4461,"As significant, the authors found that “credibility ratings associated with stealing thunder directly predicted perceptions of the crisis as less severe.” 690번 문단"
4462,"If you’ve ever seen the bank of flashing screens at a broker’s desk, you have a sense of the information overload they are up against"
4463,"When deciding whether to invest in a company, for example, they may take into account the people at the helm; the current and potential size of its market; net profits; and its past, present, and future stock value, among other pieces of information"
4464,Weighing all of these factors can take up so much of your working memory that it becomes overwhelmed
4465,"Think of having piles and piles of papers, sticky notes, and spreadsheets strewn about your desk, and you get a picture of what’s going on inside the brain"
4466,"When information overloads working memory this way, it can make brokers―and the rest of us―scrap all the strategizing and analyses and go for emotional, or gut, decisions. 691번 문단"
4467,"When considered in terms of evolutionary success, many of the seemingly irrational choices that people make do not seem so foolish after all"
4468,"Most animals, including our ancestors and modern-day capuchin monkeys, lived very close to the margin of survival"
4469,Paleontologists who study early human civilizations have uncovered evidence that our ancestors faced frequent periods of drought and freezing
4470,"When you are living on the verge of starvation, a slight downturn in your food reserves makes a lot more difference than a slight upturn"
4471,"Anthropologists who study people still living in hunter-gatherer societies have discovered that they regularly make choices designed to produce not the best opportunity for obtaining a hyperabundant supply of food but, instead, the least danger of ending up with an insufficient supply"
4472,"In other words, people everywhere have a strong motivation to avoid falling below the level that will feed themselves and their families"
4473,"If our ancestors hadn’t agonized over losses and instead had taken too many chances in going after the big gains, they’d have been more likely to lose out and never become anyone’s ancestor. 692번 문단"
4474,"According to many sociologists, the study of what our society calls ‘art’ can only really progress if we drop the highly specific and ideologically loaded terminology of ‘art’, ‘artworks’ and ‘artists’, and replace these with the more neutral and less historically specific terms ‘cultural forms’, ‘cultural products’ and ‘cultural producers’"
4475,"These cultural products―be they paintings, sculptures, forms of music or whatever―should be regarded as being made by certain types of cultural producer, and as being used by particular groups of people in particular ways in specific social contexts"
4476,"By using the more neutral term ‘cultural products’ for particular objects, and ‘cultural producers’ for the people who make those objects, the sociologist seeks to break with a view that she/he sees as having dominated the study of cultural forms for too long, namely trying to understand everything in terms of the category ‘art’"
4477,This is a category that is too limited and context-specific to encompass all the different cultural products that people in different societies make and use
4478,It is a term that is also too loaded to take at face value and to use naively in study of our own society
4479,"Since it is in the interests of certain social groups to define some things as ‘art’ and others as not, the very term ‘art’ itself cannot be uncritically used by the sociologist who wishes to understand how and why such labelling processes occur"
4480,"Quite simply, then, in order to study cultural matters, many sociologists believe one has to reject the terms ‘art’, ‘artwork’ and ‘artist’ as the basis for our analysis"
4481,"Instead, these terms become important objects of analysis themselves. 693번 문단"
4482,"Dear Ms. Molly Oliver, This is Mark Foster, one of the volunteers for the Auditory Frog and Toad Survey"

4484,I heard from another participant that a CD was used in the training session
4485,I was wondering if you could send me one
4486,"Since we have ten more days before the survey begins, I’ll have enough time to receive and use the CD to train myself"

4490,"Have you ever met someone while you were experiencing significant emotional, psychological, or physical stress? Perhaps you stayed up all night studying for a final, or maybe you learned that a grandparent recently died"
4491,You likely exhibited behaviors that are not consistent with how you usually act
4492,Meeting someone when you are extremely stressed can create an inaccurate impression of you
4493,"For this reason, recognize that our first impressions of others also may be perceptual errors"
4494,"To help avoid committing these errors, engage in perception checking, which means that we consider a series of questions to confirm or challenge our perceptions of others and their behaviors"
4495,"For example, see if you can provide two possible interpretations for the verbal and nonverbal behavior observed and seek clarification of it in order to determine the accuracy of your evaluation. 695번 문단"
4496,"When we see a happy face (or an angry one), it subtly generates the corresponding emotion in us"
4497,"To the degree we take on the pace, posture, and facial expression of another person, we start to inhabit their emotional space; as our body mimics the other’s, we begin to experience emotional matching"
4498,Our nervous system is automatically set to engage in this emotional empathy
4499,But how well we use this capacity is largely a learned ability
4500,"Animals－and people－who have been raised in extreme social isolation are poor at reading emotional cues in those around them not because they lack the basic circuitry for empathy but because, lacking emotional tutors, they have never learned to pay attention to these messages and so haven’t practiced this skill. 696번 문단"
4501,"When we hear a story, we look for beliefs that are being commented upon"
4502,Any story has many possible beliefs inherent in it
4503,But how does someone listening to a story find those beliefs? We find them by looking through the beliefs we already have
4504,We are not as concerned with what we are hearing as we are with finding what we already know that is relevant
4505,"Picture it in this way. As understanders, we have a list of beliefs, indexed by subject area"
4506,"When a new story appears, we attempt to find a belief of ours that relates to it"
4507,"When we do, we find a story attached to that belief and compare the story in our memory to the one we are processing"
4508,"Our understanding of the new story becomes, at that point, a function of the old story"
4509,"Once we find a belief and connected story, we need no further processing; that is, the search for other beliefs stops. 697번 문단"
4510,Savannas pose a bit of a problem for ecologists
4511,"There is an axiom in ecology that ‘complete competitors cannot coexist’: in other words, where two populations of organisms use exactly the same resources, one would be expected to do so slightly more efficiently than the other and therefore come to dominate in the long term"
4512,"In temperate parts of the world, either trees dominate (in forests) or grasses dominate (in grasslands)"
4513,"Yet, in savannas grasses and trees coexist"
4514,The classic explanation proposes that trees have deep roots while grasses have shallow roots
4515,The two plant types are therefore able to coexist because they are not in fact competitors: the trees increase in wetter climates and on sandier soils because more water is able to penetrate to the deep roots
4516,"Trees do indeed have a few small roots which penetrate to great depth, but most of their roots are in the top half-metre of the soil, just where the grass roots are. 698번 문단"
4517,"Lawyers and scientists use argument to mean a summary of evidence and principles leading to a conclusion; however, a scientific argument is different from a legal argument"
4518,A prosecuting attorney constructs an argument to persuade the judge or a jury that the accused is guilty; a defense attorney in the same trial constructs an argument to persuade the same judge or jury toward the opposite conclusion
4519,Neither prosecutor nor defender is obliged to consider anything that weakens their respective cases
4520,"On the contrary, scientists construct arguments because they want to test their own ideas and give an accurate explanation of some aspect of nature"
4521,"Scientists can include any evidence or hypothesis that supports their claim, but they must observe one fundamental rule of professional science"
4522,They must include all of the known evidence and all of the hypotheses previously proposed
4523,"Unlike lawyers, scientists must explicitly account for the possibility that they might be wrong. 699번 문단"
4524,The idea of protecting intellectual activity and creation has deep roots
4525,"The ancient Greeks used an awards system to recognize design achievements, which performed some of the same functions as the modern patent system"
4526,"Their pottery, sculptures, and other manufactured goods had symbols on them to note the tradesmen who created them, which are the predecessors of modern trademarks"
4527,"Similar marks and symbols functioning as trademarks have been found on Chinese pottery, possibly dating as far back as 2698 BCE, and in many other ancient societies, including the Egyptians, the Assyrians, and the Vedic civilization"
4528,The concept of intellectual property continued to develop during the Roman period
4529,The Roman Empire had an incredible variety of trademarks
4530,"Roman potters alone used approximately 6,000 trademarks"
4531,"Additionally, Roman authors had a sense that their intellectual creations were valuable, as they complained about the exploitation of those creations"
4532,Their sense of injustice was probably heightened by the fact that there were laws and traditions in place that supported their belief that only they could exploit their creations
4533,"Roman authors could, in fact, make money from the copying and publishing of their works because the value of their intellectual creations was recognized. 700번 문단"

4557,Inflation can be a major life concern for most people
4558,It makes it difficult for households to plan ahead
4559,This is because ‘future problems’ concerning inflation often make us change our plans for the future
4560,"For instance, how much should the parents of a newborn start regularly saving to pay for her college education? If inflation averages two percent, prices roughly double every thirty-six years"
4561,"But if inflation gets up to eight percent, prices roughly double every nine years"
4562,"A Harvard education that currently costs $100,000 may therefore end up costing half a million dollars for an infant born today"
4563,Millions of workers who retired with pensions during the 1960s and 1970s found that inflation pushed up costs far beyond their expected expenses
4564,Many had to reenter the workforce just to make ends meet. 704번 문단
4565,Tourism is important for more than just vacationing
4566,"Tourism allows people from different places and cultures to come together, and then tourists and host communities learn about each other’s differences and similarities"
4567,"They also learn new tastes and ways of thinking, which may lead to a better understanding between hosts and tourists"
4568,"Another positive effect of tourism is the aid it provides for the survival of a society’s culture, especially the culture’s art forms"
4569,The opportunity to sell native artworks to tourists or perform folk dances for them may encourage local artists to preserve traditional art forms

4572,There are two types of managers in business organizations: functional managers and project managers
4573,Both types of managers have different roles and qualities
4574,"Functional managers head one of a firm’s departments such as marketing or engineering, and they are specialists in the area they manage"
4575,"They are skilled at breaking the components of a system into smaller elements, knowing something of the details of each operation for which they are responsible"

4577,"When promoted to the position of project manager, they must transform from technical caterpillar to generalist butterfly"
4578,"They oversee many functional areas, each with its own specialists"
4579,"Therefore, what is required is an ability to put many pieces of a task together to form a coherent whole"

4581,"It isn’t going to be easy making changes to the food your children eat, and even the most careful, patient parents will probably find that the little ones will resist at some point and to some degree"
4582,The problem is that many of us were forced to eat in a healthy way as children: we learned the hard way
4583,And the temptation to continue with these parental habits with our own children is strong
